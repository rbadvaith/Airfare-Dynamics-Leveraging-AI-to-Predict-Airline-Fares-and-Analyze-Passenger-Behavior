In our project, "Airfare Dynamics: Leveraging AI to Predict Airline Fares and Analyze Passenger Behavior," we explored the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to address the complexities of airfare pricing and passenger trends. Using the Consumer Airfare Report dataset, we developed and evaluated four AI-based models—Neural Network, XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM—to predict airfare trends and analyze passenger behavior. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy but was computationally intensive, while LightGBM emerged as the preferred model for dynamic price comparisons due to its efficiency and robustness. XGBoost excelled in passenger traffic analysis, effectively capturing key factors like distance and booking timing, whereas the Neural Network underperformed, emphasizing the importance of model selection in AI applications.

Our AI-driven analysis revealed critical insights into passenger behavior: 52.96% of travelers are price-sensitive, 83.16% prefer early bookings, and medium-haul routes are the most popular (51.88%). These findings highlight the potential of AI to optimize pricing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency for airlines. Future work includes expanding the dataset and exploring real-time AI prediction systems to further revolutionize the airline industry. This project was a collaborative effort, with each team member contributing equally to its success, showcasing the transformative power of AI in solving real-world challenges.
